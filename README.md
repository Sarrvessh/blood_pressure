This repository contains a Flask web application that predicts systolic and diastolic blood pressure based on several input features. The app uses a pre-trained multi-output regression model to make predictions.

## Features:
- Predicts systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a set of 22 input features.
- Built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.
- Uses `joblib` to load the pre-trained model for predictions.

## Prerequisites:
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood-pressure-prediction.git
   cd blood-pressure-prediction
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Flask app:
  python app.py

4.Open the web app:
  Once the Flask app is running, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the prediction interface.

## Usage:
Input the data into the provided form for the following features:

Sex (M/F): Gender of the person (M for Male, F for Female).
Age (years): Age of the person.
Height (cm): Height of the person.
Weight (kg): Weight of the person.
Heart Rate (b/m): Heart rate in beats per minute.
BMI (kg/mÂ²): Body Mass Index.
Hypertension (1/0): Whether the person has hypertension (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Diabetes (1/0): Whether the person has diabetes (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Cerebral Infarction (1/0): Whether the person has had a cerebral infarction (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Cerebrovascular Disease (1/0): Whether the person has cerebrovascular disease (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Segment 1-3: Segment features for input (numeric values).
Mean 1-3: Mean values for input (numeric values).
Variance 1-3: Variance values for input (numeric values).
Skewness 1-3: Skewness values for input (numeric values).
Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted systolic and diastolic blood pressure values.

## Example Output:
After submitting the form, the web app will display:

Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg): Predicted systolic value.
Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg): Predicted diastolic value.

## Notes:
The app assumes that the pre-trained model is properly loaded and the input data is correctly formatted.
The input features must match the expected format and number (22 features) to work correctly with the model.
